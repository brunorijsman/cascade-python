What is in this GitHub repository?
==================================

This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the Cascade information reconciliation protocol. Information reconciliation protocols in general, and the Cascade protocol in particular, are a small but important and complex classical post-processing step in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. They are intended to detect and correct inevitable bit errors in the distributed key.

This repository also contains Python scripts that analyze the Cascade protocol and reproduce the analysis results that were previously reported in the following academic papers:

* Jesus Martinez-Mateo, Christoph Pacher, Momtchil Peev, Alex Ciurana, and Vicente Martin. `Demystifying the Information Reconciliation Protocol Cascade. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.3257.pdf>`_ arXiv:1407.3257 [quant-ph], Jul 2014.

Finally, this repository contains extensive documentation describing the Cascade protocol, our implementation of the Cascade protocol, the findings of reproducing the Cascade analysis results from the academic literature, and lessons learned.

The broader context.
====================

The code in this GitHub repository is just a small step in the larger project of adding full support for quantum key distribution (QKD) to OpenSSL. This larger project includes other GitHub repositories:

* The `openssl-qkd <https://github.com/brunorijsman/openssl-qkd>`_ GitHub repository contains a C implementation of a dynamically loaded engine for OpenSSL. This engine replace a classic Diffie-Hellman key exchange with a quantum key distribution (QKD) mechanism. The actual quantum key distribution protocol is not part of this repository. Instead, the engine invokes a stub implementation of `application programmer interface (API) <https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/QKD/001_099/004/01.01.01_60/gs_qkd004v010101p.pdf>`_ defined by European telecommunications standards institute (ETSI).

* The `simulaqron-bb84-python <https://github.com/brunorijsman/simulaqron-bb84-python>`_ GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. It runs on top of the `SimulaQron <http://www.simulaqron.org/>`_ quantum network simulator.

All of these repositories are also just small steps working towards the overall goal adding full support for quantum key distribution to OpenSSL. Much work remains to be done, which is summarized at the end of this chapter.

Once the OpenSSL library supports quantum key distribution, many applications that use OpenSSL (such as for example web servers and web clients) will be able to use quantum key distribution with little or no code changes to the application itself.

The initial goal is to support simulated quantum networks using simulators such as `SimulaQron <http://www.simulaqron.org/>`_ or `NetSquid <https://netsquid.org/>`_, both developed at `QuTech <https://netsquid.org/>`_. But by building on top of a well-defined application programming interface (namely the `ETSI QKD API <https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/QKD/001_099/004/01.01.01_60/gs_qkd004v010101p.pdf>`_) it is conceivable that our code will be able to interoperate with real quantum key distribution devices that are being developed in academia and by commercial vendors.

The pan-European quantum Internet hackathon.
============================================

This project has its roots in the `Pan-European Quantum Internet Hackathon <https://labs.ripe.net/Members/ulka_athale_1/take-part-in-pan-european-quantum-internet-hackathon>`_ which took place on 5 and 6 November 2019 and which was organized by `RIPE labs <https://labs.ripe.net/>`_ .

Participants from six geographically distributed locations (Delft, Dublin, Geneva, Padua, Paris, and Sarajevo) formed teams that worked on various projects related to the `Quantum Internet <https://qutech.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Quantum-internet-A-vision.pdf>`_.

I participated in Delft where the hackathon was hosted by QuTech, a world-leading quantum technology research and development office within the `Delft University of Technology <https://www.tudelft.nl/>`_.

The OpenSSL integration challenge.
==================================

In Delft, I joined a team working on one of the `challenges suggested by the hackathon organizers <https://github.com/PEQI19/challenges>`_, namely the `OpenSSL integration challenge <https://github.com/PEQI19/PEQI-OpenSSL>`_.

This challenge was developed by `Wojciech Kozlowski <https://www.linkedin.com/in/wojciech-kozlowski/>`_, a postdoctoral researcher at QuTech and one of the organizers of the Delft hackathon. He is also the main author of the `Architectural Principles of the Quantum Internet <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-qirg-principles/>`_ document that is being developed in the `Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG) <https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/qirg/about/>`_ in the `Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) <https://irtf.org/>`_.

The OpenSSL integration challenge consists of two parts:

1. Enhance `OpenSSL <http://openssl.org/>`_ to be able to use `Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution>`_ as a `key agreement protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-agreement_protocol>`_. OpenSSL is an open source cryptography library that implements the `Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_ protocols. OpenSSL is widely used in Internet applications such as web browsers and web servers.

2. Implement a specific quantum key distribution protocol, namely the `Bennett and Brassard 1984 (BB84) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84>`_ protocol, on top of the SimulaQron quantum network simulator.

The end-goal of the challenge is to use an off-the-shelf browser (e.g. Chrome) and connect it to a secure HTTPS website hosted on an off-the-shelf web server (e.g. Apache), while using the BB84 quantum key distribution algorithm as the key agreement protocol (running a `SimulaQron <http://www.simulaqron.org/>`_ simulated quantum network), instead of the classical Diffie-Hellman protocol that is normally used in classical networks.

Integration of OpenSSL with the stub ETSI QKD API.
==================================================

The following figure shows what was actually achieved soon after the end of the hackathon.

This is called the "upper half" of the solution for the OpenSSL integration challenge. The source code for this upper half implementation can be found in GitHub repository `openssl-qkd <https://github.com/brunorijsman/openssl-qkd>`_ and the documentation can be found on `this page <https://brunorijsman.github.io/openssl-qkd/>`_.

At the hackathon there was another team working on the "lower half" of the OpenSSL challenge. They were working on an implementation of the BB84 protocol running on SimulaQron. This BB84 implementation would provide a north-bound interface in the form of the ETSI QKD API.

The hope was that by the end of the hackathon the "upper half" (the OpenSSL engine that consumes the ETSI QKD API) could be integrated with the "lower half" (the BB84 implementation that provides the ETSI QKD API). We did not quite make that goal during the hackathon itself. We picked up the work where the hackathon left off.

Python implementation of BB84 on SimulaQron.
============================================

The GitHub repository `simulaqron-bb84-python <https://github.com/brunorijsman/simulaqron-bb84-python>`_ contains our Python implementation of BB84 running on SimulaQron. We essentially re-did the work that was done by the other hackathon team.

You can think of it as an exercise to get familiar with BB84 and with the CQC interface provided by SimulaQron. It is a fully functional implementation of BB84 that runs on SimulaQron. However, it is not very suitable as an implementation of the "lower half" that can be integrated with the "upper half" implementation in the `openssl-qkd <https://github.com/brunorijsman/openssl-qkd>`_ repository. This is because Python code can not easily be integrated with C code into a dynamically loaded library that can be used as an OpenSSL engine. Yes, it is technically possible, but we prefer to rewrite the Cascade code in C (or maybe C++ or Rust); we consider the Python code to be a prototype (we did prototyping in Python because it is much easier to experiment in Python than in C).

Python implementation of Cascade.
=================================

The openssl-qkd repository only contains code for the quantum phase of BB84; it does not contain any classical post-processing code: both the information reconciliation step and the privacy amplification step are missing.

This GitHub repository `cascade-python <https://github.com/brunorijsman/cascade-python>`_ contains a Python implementation of the information reconciliation step.

C++ implementation of Cascade.
==============================

Soon after implementing Cascade in Python (this repository), I reimplemented it in C++ (GitHub repository `cascade-cpp <https://github.com/brunorijsman/cascade-cpp>`_).

The main reason for reimplementing Cascade in C++ was that the Python code was too slow. The "make data-papers" target in the Python code does 1,000 Cascade iterations per data point and takes more than 5 days of continuous running on an AWS m5.2xlarge instance (120 hours x US$ 0.40 per hour = US$ 48 in compute cost). By contrast, the "make data-papers" target the C++ code does 10,000 Cascade iterations per data point (10x better accuracy) only takes ten hours to complete (US$ 4).

Also, the C++ was more carefully debugged than the Python code and has some extra debugging functionality.

Next steps.
===========

These are the remaining work-items for completing the work of implementing an OpenSSL engine that uses BB84 running on SimulaQron:

1. Implement a Python prototype for privacy amplification.

2. Implement one or more Python prototypes for other information reconciliation protocols, such as Golay codes.

3. Add a north-bound ETSI QKD API.

4. Rewrite the Python implementation of Cascade and the other information reconciliation protocols into C or C++ or Rust and integrate with the BB84 code.

5. Rewrite the Python implementation of privacy amplification into C or C++ or Rust and integrate with the BB84 code.

6. Demonstrate running Chrome and Apache on top of the QKD OpenSSL engine.

This Github project has been superseded by Github project [Cascade-CPP](https://github.com/brunorijsman/cascade-cpp), which is a port of the Python code in this repository to C++. The
C++ code runs about 100x faster because C++ is faster than Python but mostly because the C++
code has been much more heavily optimized. Also, the C++ code is more reliable because it has
been more carefully debugged. I recommend that you read the documentation in the link below
for an introduction to the Cascade algorithm. But when it comes to running code, I recommend
the C++ code over the Python code.

Cascade information reconciliation protocol for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).
